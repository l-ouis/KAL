# Testing

To obtain outputs, run `convert_single_midi.py` on a MIDI file (melody) that you would like.

Then, run `generate_harmonies.py` to generate an output. You can change the temperature and number of loops to generate.

To create graphs of *training data (not output data)*, run `make_graphs.py`.
